== Message encoder
==================================

Overview
-------------------
The goal of this project is to provide a mechanism for consumers to send "encoded" messages to other consumers.  These messages will be "encoded" so that they are unreadable.  Along with the encoded message, the consumer will send a question with the encoded message. The receiving consumer will need to correctly answer a question to decode the message.

General Use Case
--------------------
A user will visit the website. They will provide:
 1) A message. There will be room for a long message.  This will likely be a large text box.
 2) A question.  This will be used to decode the message.  This will be a a medium sized text box.
 3) The question Answer.  This word will be used to decode the message.  This should be one word.

The user will then have a variety of ways to show that message to someone else
 1) They can send a link to the encoded message to their friend.  The receiving consumer can then go to that link and attempt to answer the question correctly to see the decoded message.
 2) The user could enter the receiving consumer's email and the system can send them an email detailing what they would need to do to get the original message.
 3) The user might receive an encoded message with a link to the website.  They will then be able to put the encoded message and the password into a box to decode the message.


Specific Use Cases
--------------------
1. A consumer sends a love message to their intimate partner.  The question "How much do I love you?".  The receiving consumer would need to enter "lots" in order to decode the message.

2. Facebook.  Users would be able to post "encoded" messages in facebook on their wall.  Only users who know their secret would be able to read those messages.

3. Twitter.  Users can post an encoded message to their twitter feed with a bit.ly link (bit.ly is a URL shortener) to our website to decode it.

Monetization
--------------------
1. Ads.  We will serve contextually relevant ads on the website.  Initially, we will use adsense to serve these ads.  Hopefully, a $3 eCPM is achievable initially.

2. Consumer Engagement.  Advertisers will be able to engage their consumers by sending encoded messages to consumers.  The question in this case might force the consumer to do some research about the produce before receiving the message.  The message may include an incentive, such as a coupon or other offer.  We could sell clients skinned versions of the website and leads.  Leads would be worth $2-4.  Skinned versions of the site would likely fetch a one time premium and a monthly upkeep cost ($10k/$500).

Costs
--------------------
1.  We will need to send mail from this domain.  Thus, we will need a new ip.  We will need additionally capacity on the server as well.   I presume this cost will be approximately $30 a month.

Promotion Opporunities
--------------------
 In order to get this website off the ground, we will need to promote it.  There are many ways to promote it.

1. Display ads
2. Forums, word of mouth, viral
